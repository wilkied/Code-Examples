# Code-Examples and Resume
These files are examples of code I have written in various programming languages for project requirements in several OSU computer progamming classes.  While some of the code is stand alone, the majority are selections extracted from completed projects and are meant to serve as a illustration of my programming skills.  I have also included a PDF version of my resume with some personal information removed.
